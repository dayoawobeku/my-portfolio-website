<AnchorTag text="Why Google Chrome" href="why-google-chrome" />

{<Text>Google Chrome was introduced in 2008 as a lightweight alternative to
other web browsers, such as Internet Explorer and Firefox. It was designed to be
fast, secure, and easy-to-use, and has since become one of the most popular web
browsers in the world.</Text>}

{<Text>Here are some of the main reasons why Google Chrome is so popular:

{<Text>If you want to get Google Chrome on your phone, simply click {' '}

<ExternalUrl text='this link' href='https://www.google.com/chrome/go-mobile/'/> {' '}
to download the app from the Google Play Store or the App Store.</Text>}

{<Text>Or, if you want to install it manually, here's how:</Text>}

<Text>For Android:</Text>

<ListItems

{<Text>Once you've got Google Chrome installed, you'll want to make sure it's
your go-to browser. This way, when you click on links from other apps they'll
open up in Chrome, and your searches and browser data will be synced across all
your devices.

</Text>}

{<Text>Here's how to do it on Android and iOS:

</Text>}

<Text>Android:</Text>

<ListItems
  items={[
    {
      text: 'Go to settings',
    },
    {
      text: ['Tap ', <BoldText text="Apps" />],
    },
    {
      text: [
        'Under ',
        '"General,"',
        ' select ',
        <BoldText text="Default apps" />,

        <BoldText text="Browser app" />,
        ' > ',
        <BoldText text="Chrome" />,
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

<Text>iOS:</Text>

<ListItems
  items={[
    {
      text: 'Open settings',
    },
    {
      text: 'Scroll to the list of installed apps and tap Chrome',
    },
    {
      text: ['Select ', <BoldText text="Default Browser App" />],
    },
    {
      text: ['Tap ', <BoldText text="Chrome" />],
    },
  ]}
/>

<AnchorTag text="Navigation" href="navigation" />

{<Text>Chrome has 2 main navigation tools: the address bar and the tab bar.

</Text>}

{<Text>Some browsers use an address bar for navigating to websites and a search
bar for conducting web searches. Google Chrome combines these two elements into
one bar, known as the <BoldText text="Omnibox" />. By integrating Google's
search technology, the Omnibox offers suggestions for websites or potential web
searches as you type, which makes navigating the Web faster and easier.

</Text>}

{<Text>Here's how the Omnibox works:</Text>}

<ListItems
  items={[
    {
      text: [
        'Type a web address or search query into the omnibox at the top of the screen. You can also type into the ',
        <BoldText text="'Search or type URL'" />,
        ' field on the home screen.',
        <SideBySideImage
          src1={topAddressBar}
          alt1="omnibox on the top of the screen"
          src2={addressBarLayout}
          alt2="omnibox on ios"
        />,
      ],
    },
    {
      text: [
        'Suggestions will appear below the omnibox.',
        <Image
          src={addressBar}
          width={828}
          height={414}
          alt="omnibox with suggestions"
        />,
      ],
    },
    {
      text: [
        'Tap on one of these suggestions to navigate to the suggested website or search query.',
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

{<Text>The tab bar is used to switch between open tabs. You can open a new tab
by tapping the <BoldText text="'+'" /> button in the tab bar.</Text>}

<SideBySideImage
  src1={iosTabBar}
  alt1="ios tab bar"
  src2={androidTabBar}
  alt2="android tab bar"
/>

{<Text>The page content is located in the middle of the browser window and is
used to display the content of the current web page. You can scroll up and down
to view the entire page, and you can zoom in and out by pinching the screen with
two fingers.</Text>}

<Image
  src={content}
  width={414}
  height={896}
  alt="google chrome page content"
/>

{<Text>Google Chrome allows you to open multiple tabs at the same time. This is
a great way to keep track of multiple web pages at once and to easily switch
between them. To view the list of open tabs, tap the square button in the tab
bar <ItalicizedText text='(highlighted red below)' />.</Text>}

<Image src={tabsList} width={828} height={414} alt="open tabs list" />

{<Text>Once you've opened the list of open tabs, you can switch between tabs by
tapping on them. You can also close tabs by tapping the <BoldText text="'x'" />
button in the top right corner of each tab or by long-pressing on a tab and
tapping <BoldText text="'Close tab'" />.</Text>}

{<Text>The icon on the left of the tabs menu allows you to switch to incognito
mode, and and if you want to check out your browsing history or recently closed
tabs, there's an icon on the right you can use.</Text>}

<Image src={tabsMenu} width={414} height={896} alt="google chrome tabs menu" />

{<Text>On iOS, the back (<BoldText text="'<'" />) and forward
(<BoldText text="'>'" />) buttons are in the bottom left corner of the browser
window. These buttons allow you to navigate backward and forward through your
browsing history. If you swipe left or right on the page content, you can also
go back or forward.</Text>}

<Image
  src={iosNavigation}
  width={828}
  height={325}
  alt="navigation buttons on ios"
/>

{<Text>On Android, you have to press the phone's back button to go back a page
and tap the menu button in the top right corner (<BoldText text="'⋮'" />) then
tap {' '}

<BoldText text="'>'" /> to go forward.</Text>}

<SideBySideImage
  src1={openAndroidMenu}
  alt1="tap to open android menu"
  src2={androidForward}
  alt2="tap to go forward"
/>

{<Text>There are 4 other buttons in the top right of the opened menu. To reload
the page, tap the <BoldText text="'⟳'" /> button. You can also reload by swiping
down the page content on either iOS and Android. To view the site info, tap the

{' '}

<BoldText text="'i'" /> button. To download the page, tap the
{' '}
<BoldText text="'⇩'" /> button. </Text>}

{<Text>You can also save your favorite websites as bookmarks for easy access. To
bookmark a page on Android, tap the {' '}

<BoldText text="'⭐'" /> button.{' '}

</Text>}

<Image
  src={androidBookmark}
  width={393}
  height={206}
  alt="bookmark button on android"
/>

{<Text>After you've bookmarked a page, you can view your bookmarks by tapping

{' '} <BoldText text="'Bookmarks'" /> in the opened menu. <ItalicizedText text='
Notice that the bookmark button has changed to a filled star. You can tap the filled star to remove the bookmark.'/>

</Text>}

<SideBySideImage
  src1={androidBookmarked}
  alt1="bookmarked page on android"
  src2={androidBookmarks}
  alt2="android bookmarks"

{<Text>For iOS, it's a little different. Tap the <BoldText text="'...'" />
button in the lower right corner of the browser window to open the menu.

</Text>}

<Image src={iosMenuBtn} width={828} height={325} alt="ios menu button" />

{<Text>Tap <BoldText text="'Add to Bookmarks'" /> to bookmark the current
page.{' '} And to view your bookmarks, tap <BoldText text="'Bookmarks'" /> in
the opened menu.

<AnchorTag text="Browsing History" href="browsing-history" />

{<Text>Like every other browser, Google Chrome keeps detailed records of your
browsing history. Chrome uses this information to make suggestions when you're
in the omnibox and to help you find pages you've visited in the past. Chrome
also uses some of this information to decrease load times for pages you've
visited before.</Text>}

<AnchorTag text="Browsing Tips and Tricks" href="browsing-tips-and-tricks" />

{<Text>Chrome has a ton of awesome features that will make your browsing
experience way more enjoyable. These are some of my favorite features that'll
help you get the most out of Google Chrome on your mobile device.</Text>}

{<Text>

  <BoldText text="1. Find texts in page" />
</Text>}
{<Text>One of the most useful features in Google Chrome is the ability to search for text on a web page. To search for text, tap the{' '} <BoldText text="'...'" /> button in the lower right corner or tap the menu button in the top right corner of the browser window, and then tap <BoldText text="'Find in page'" />.</Text>
}

{<Text>You'll see a search bar, type in what you're looking for and then tap

{' '}

<BoldText text="'^'" /> or <BoldText text="'v'" /> to find the next or
previous instance of that search.</Text>}

{<Text>Tap {' '} <BoldText text="'x' / 'Done'" /> when you're good.</Text>}

{<Text>

  <BoldText text="2. Tab management" />
</Text>}

{<Text>Earlier, I showed you how to open multiple tabs at the same time. Chrome
also offers a few other ways to manage your tabs more efficiently. For example,
you can long-press on a link to open it in a new tab. You can also drag and drop
tabs to rearrange them. Slick, <ItalicizedText text='huh?'/>

</Text>}

{<Text>

  <BoldText text="3. Voice search" />
</Text>}

{<Text>Did you know that you can search for things using your voice? Just tap
the microphone button in the search bar, say what you want and Chrome will turn
it into text.</Text>}

{<Text><BoldText text="4. Managing passwords" /></Text>}

{<Text>Chrome's built-in password manager allows you to save and autofill
passwords for websites. This can save you time and make it easier to manage your
passwords. To access Chrome's password manager, go to the Settings menu and
select <BoldText text="'Password Manager'" /> to see your saved passwords and
manage them.</Text>}

{<Text><BoldText text="5. Reading list" /></Text>}

{<Text>Using Chrome's reading list feature, you can save articles and web pages
to read later. On iOS, tap the {' '}

<BoldText text="'...'" /> button in the lower right corner and tap{' '}

<BoldText text="'Add to reading list'" />.</Text>}

{<Text>It's a little different on Android as the feature is still experimental.
Here's how you can enable the reading list feature on your Android device:

{<Text>Syncing Chrome across devices is a great way to keep your bookmarks,
passwords, and other data in sync across all your devices. To sync Chrome across
devices, you'll need to sign in to Chrome with your Google account. Tap the menu
button, then tap <BoldText text="'Settings'" /> and then{' '}

<BoldText text="'Sign in to Chrome'" />. Enter your Google account credentials
and then tap <BoldText text="'Sign in'" />. Chrome will sync your data across all
your devices.

</Text>}

{<Text>Once you've signed in to Chrome, you can choose what data you want to
sync. By default, Chrome will sync your bookmarks, passwords, and other data. To
change what data you want to sync, tap the menu button, then tap {' '}

<BoldText text="'Settings'" /> and then <BoldText text="'Sync'" />. Turn off the {' '}
<BoldText text="'Sync everything'" /> button to {' '} <ItalicizedText text='un-sync' /> all your data and then select the options you want to sync.
</Text>}

{<Text>Now, whenever you sign in to Chrome on another device {' '}

<BoldText text="with the same Google account," /> your data will be in sync. When
you bookmark a page on one device, it will be available on all your devices. When
you save a password on one device, it will be available on all your devices. You
get the idea.
