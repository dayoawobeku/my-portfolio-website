{<Text>Sometime in January last year along with all the new year fever, I
thought it‚Äôd be cool to have a website of my own. <BoldText text='TL:DR' /> I
completed and took it live in September.</Text>}

{<Text>Have you tried toggling the dark/light mode? Depending on what time of
the year you read this, have you clicked on the tiny snow (‚ùÑÔ∏è) icon on the
navigation? These are great, no doubt, but this blog post is majorly about the

<BoldText text="‚Äòhow‚Äô" /> I built the website.

{<Text>First, I had big aspirations. I wanted my website to be sick! Yeah! Like
all those fancy websites on {' '}

<ExternalUrl href='https://awwwards.com/' text='awwwards.com' />. Most of all, I
wanted it to be <BoldText text='unique' />. It‚Äôs my space on {' '}
<ExternalUrl href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee' text='Sir
Tim-Berners-Lee' />'s World Wide Web after all!</Text>} 
{<Text>Second, I paid
someone to design a logo and brand identity. I still don‚Äôt have any.</Text>}

{<Text>By February, I started designing the website myself. Yup, I have {''}

{<Text>After designing and prototyping on {''}

<ExternalUrl href='https://figma.com/' text='Figma' /> for a couple of weeks, I
was proud of what I had done and I asked some of my friends for feedback. Boy, my <BoldText text='‚Äútech‚Äù' /> friends loved it! My <BoldText text='‚Äúnon-tech‚Äù' /> friends on the other hand had almost no clue what was going
on.</Text>}

{<Text> That was more than enough feedback for me. One of my primary goals for
the website was to provide recruiters a means to find and reach out to me. And
since a large percentage of recruiters are non-technical, they‚Äôd probably find
the website a little bit not too {' '}

{<Text>So, I went back to the drawing board and started designing the website
from scratch. Did I mention that I already started to build the previous design?
Yep. Had to throw all that away too. </Text>}

<AnchorTag text="The redesign" href="the-redesign" />

{<Text> I started the redesign in the middle of April. I spent the first week
looking at other websites and trying to figure out what I liked and what I
didn‚Äôt. I also spent a lot of time on {' '}

<ExternalUrl href='https://dribbble.com/' text='Dribbble' />. I was looking for a design that was simple, clean, and easy to navigate. I
also wanted it to be unique. I wanted it to be me. </Text>}

{<Text> I stumbled upon this {''}

<ExternalUrl

that is a curation of really nice portfolio websites.
I screenshotted a few and started to play around with them. By the end of April, I had a direction and I was happy with it. I created some
mockups and wireframes and started hacking away.</Text>}

{<Text>Choosing a color palette was easy. Monochrome üíÄ. 100% white and black
with the lightness value

tweaked a little.</Text>}
{<Text>For choice of font, my priority was something that was easy to read. And cute. I ended up choosing {''} <ExternalUrl href="https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/satoshi" text="Satoshi"/>.

 is a great alternative too if you‚Äôre looking for something similar.</Text>}

{<Text> I completed the redesign 2 months later in July and started building in
August.</Text>}
