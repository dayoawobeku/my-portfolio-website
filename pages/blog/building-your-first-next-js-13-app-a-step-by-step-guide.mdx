{<Text>These new features, along with other improvements, make Next.js 13 a
must-have for developers looking to build high-quality web applications quickly
and efficiently.</Text>}

{<Text>One of the main selling points of Next.js 13 is its introduction of {''}

<ExternalUrl text='Server Components' href='https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/rendering/server-and-client-components#server-components' />, a new feature that simplifies server-side rendering by
allowing developers to write server-side logic using React components.</Text>}

{<Text>In this blog post, we will not only explore the new features and
improvements introduced in Next.js version 13 but also build a sample web
application together to demonstrate their capabilities. We'll discuss how these
features can benefit developers in building better web applications, while also
highlighting the performance enhancements, security updates, and other changes
that make Next.js 13 a significant upgrade from the previous versions.</Text>}

{<Text>So, let's dive into the world of Next.js 13 and build a powerful web
application with ease!</Text>}

<AnchorTag text="The app directory" href="the-app-directory" />

{<Text>Next.js 13 introduces a new app routing system that brings new
possibilities and performance improvements to the framework. While the new app
router works similarly to the previous pages router, it offers some key
differences that make it a superior option.</Text>}

{<Text>Firstly, the app router is built in such a way that it is 100%
incrementally adoptable while still maintaining the pages router, all within the
same application. This means that developers can migrate to the new router
system at their own pace and without breaking their existing codebase.</Text>}

{<Text>Inside our project's app directory, you'll find css files for styling the
project, but we'll be using Tailwindcss instead. Additionally, you'll notice a
head.tsx file, which was a temporary fix to do metadata inside of the new app
router. However, a newer and better approach was introduced in Next.js 13.2, and
the head.tsx file was deprecated. We'll cover how to migrate to the new API
later on.</Text>}

{<Text>The new app directory uses a file system-based routing system, but it's
now all directory-based with various naming conventions for different use cases.
To create a new page, simply create a directory with the name of the route and
add a page.tsx file to it that exports the component you want to display. You
can also colocate extra non-route components in the same directory instead of
creating a separate components directory.</Text>}

{<Text>In addition, the new app directory also includes error.tsx and
loading.tsx files. The error.tsx file allows you to customize the error page
that is displayed when there is a server-side error or a client-side navigation
error, while the loading.tsx file allows you to customize the loading indicator
that is displayed during page transitions. These files give you more control
over the look and feel of your application, making it easier to provide a better
user experience.</Text>}

{<Text>Finally, the layout.tsx file wraps all of the pages with a layout, and
each page can have its own unique layout. These changes in the app directory
structure offer more flexibility and organization options for
developers.</Text>}

{<Text>All of these will come in handy when we start building out our project.
So, enough talk, let's start building out our Next.js 13 app!</Text>}
