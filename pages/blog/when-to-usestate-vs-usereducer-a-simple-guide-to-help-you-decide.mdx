{<Text>Have you ever wondered when to use the <QuoteText quote="useState"/> and
{' '}<QuoteText quote="useReducer"/> {''} hooks? I have, and I've found that
there's a simple way to decide. I'll show you how to use this simple rule to
decide when to use either, or both.</Text>}

{<Text>

<ExternalUrl
  text="Hooks"
  href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#but-what-is-a-hook"
/> {''}were first introduced into the React community in version 16.8.

They’re basically functions that let you <BoldText text='“hook”'/> into a
component’s state. Hooks work only inside functional components.

</Text>}

{<Text><QuoteText quote="useState"/> is the most common hook and it allows you
to add state to a functional component. State is data, usually data that can
change over time. <QuoteText quote="useState"/> is most useful when you have a
single piece of state that is simple to update. For example, a boolean {''}

<QuoteText quote="isOpen"/> value, or some other <ExternalUrl
  text="primitive"
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive"
/>  value such as a text
input.</Text>}

{<Text><QuoteText quote="useReducer"/> is similar to {''}

<QuoteText quote="useState"/>, but it's more useful when you have multiple
pieces of state that are related to each other.</Text>}

{<Text>Let's look at an example. Let's say we have a component that has a button
that increments and decrements a counter. We can use {''}

<QuoteText quote="useState"/> to manage the counter state.</Text>}

{<Codesandbox src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/weathered-currying-vncl4b?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&codemirror=1&module=/src/App.jsx" />}

{<Text>This is a contrived example, but it's a good place to start. Now, let’s
get our simple counter to work with <QuoteText quote="useReducer"/> just to get
familiar with the basics.

</Text>}

{<Codesandbox src="https://codesandbox.io/embed/aged-microservice-eqyp97?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&codemirror=1&module=/src/App.jsx" />}

{<Text>Essentially, with <QuoteText quote="useState"/>, you <ExternalUrl
  text="destructure"
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment"
/> 2 values: the current state (<ItalicizedText text='count' />); and a {''}

<ExternalUrl
  text="set/update function"
  href="https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useState#setstate"
/>

(<ItalicizedText text='setCount' />). Then in-between the {''}

<QuoteText quote="useState" /> function, you pass in the initial state value (<ItalicizedText text="0" />
).

</Text>}

{<Text><QuoteText quote="useReducer" /> on the other hand returns an array with
exactly 2 items: the current state; and a

<ExternalUrl
  text="dispatch function."
  href="https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useReducer#dispatch"
/> {''}
Then in-between the {''}

<QuoteText quote="useReducer" /> function, you pass 2 arguments: a reducer function;
and the initial state value. There's a third, optional <ExternalUrl
  text="init"
  href="https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useReducer#parameters"
/> argument but it can be omitted.

</Text>}

{<Text>The reducer function takes 2 arguments: the current state value; and the
action value passed to the dispatch function. Scroll back up and see if it makes
more sense. Yeah? Nope? Keep reading.

</Text>}

<AnchorTag
  text="Cool, so technically they do the same thing?"
  href="cool-so-technically-they-do-the-same-thing"
/>

{<Text>Yes, exactly! They are equivalent. You can always convert between {''}

<QuoteText quote="useState" /> and <QuoteText quote="useReducer" /> back and forth.
Personally, I prefer to use <QuoteText quote="useReducer" /> when I have more complicated state because it's flexible and allows you to do more things. It's also a bit more complicated to use, but it's worth it. Let's look
at another example.</Text>}

{<Text>Let's create a todo list where we can add, edit, and delete todos. We'll
use both <QuoteText quote="useState" /> and <QuoteText quote="useReducer" />.
Ready? Let's go!</Text>}
