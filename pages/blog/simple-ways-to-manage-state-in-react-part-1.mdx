<InfoNote note="TL:DR React is a state management library." />
<Text>Hear me out.</Text>
{
  <Text>
    Managing state is arguably one of the most difficult things to do in React.
    State is data, usually data that can change. There are a plethora of options
    and opinions. One of the reasons this is so is failure to separate concerns,
    or better still, state type.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Most applications you will ever build will have 2 types of state: {''}
    <QuoteText quote="client/application state" />; and <QuoteText quote="server cache." />
    First step in managing state with React is knowing the difference between
    these 2 types of state and where and how to manage them.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Client state refers to state that lives within your application, that is,
    it’s only useful in the UI for controlling interactive parts (like modal{' '}
    <QuoteText quote="isOpenstate" />, an active nav link, form input value).
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    {' '}
    Server cache on the other hand is state that's actually stored on the server
    and we store in the client for quick-access (like user data). Think of it this
    way: A list of articles that you fetch, the details of a User you want to display,
    etc), your app does not own it. We have only borrowed it to display the most
    recent version of it on the screen for the user. It is the server who owns the
    data.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Server cache is not the same as UI state and should be handled differently.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    React has made state management simple (not easy, but
    <ItalicizedText text=" plain and basic enough to understand" /> ). Let’s talk
    about the client state first and ways to manage it.
  </Text>
}
<AnchorTag text="Client state" href="client-state" />
{
  <Text>
    Client state is simply state managed inherently in the UI. It can be further
    separated into local client state and global client state.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Local state is UI state that is used in a single or few components that are{' '}
    <QuoteText quote="colocated" />. State colocation simply means to state as
    close to where it's relevant as possible. {''}
    <ExternalUrl
      href="https://kentcdodds.com/blog/colocation"

    /> by {''}
    <ExternalUrl

      href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/"
    />{' '}
    <ExternalUrl href="https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/" text="Dan Abramov" />{' '}
    said something similar: "Things that change together should be located as
    close as reasonable.”
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Colocation can improve the overall maintenance of our application.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Let’s look at an example of <QuoteText quote="colocating" /> and {''}
    <QuoteText quote="lifting state." />{' '}
  </Text>
}
<CodeBlock
  value={`import { useState } from 'react';
  
function Name({ name, handleNameChange }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <label>Name</label>
      <input value={name} onChange={handleNameChange} />
    </div>
  );
}
  
function BestFood() {
  const [food, setFood] = useState("");
  
  const handleFoodChange = (event) => setFood(event.target.value);
  return (
    <div>
      <label>Food</label>
      <input value={food} onChange={handleFoodChange} />
    </div>
  );
}
  
function Display({ name }) {
  return <div>Hey {name}, you are great.</div>;
}
  
export default function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  
  const handleNameChange = (event) => setName(event.target.value);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Name name={name} handleNameChange={handleNameChange} />
      <BestFood />
      <Display name={name} />
    </div>
  );
}`}
/>
{
  <Text>
    At the moment, we’re only rendering the name of the person in the {''}
    <QuoteText quote="app" /> component. What if we need to access the {''}
    <QuoteText quote="food" /> prop in the <QuoteText quote="app" />
    component?
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    How are we going to get access to the <QuoteText quote="food" /> if our
    state is living in the <QuoteText quote="Bestfood" /> component? Both {''}
    <QuoteText quote="Bestfood" /> and <QuoteText quote="Display" /> components are
    sibling components so the <QuoteText quote="BestFood" /> component cannot pass
    the food to the Display component.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    The solution is to do the same thing we’re currently doing for the {''}
    <QuoteText quote="Name" /> component; which is "lift the <QuoteText quote="food" />{' '}
    state" from the <QuoteText quote="BestFood" /> component to the least common
    parent, the <QuoteText quote="App" /> component, and then pass the <QuoteText quote="food" />{' '}
    state and the mechanism for updating that state as props to the component that
    needs it.
  </Text>
}
<CodeBlock
  value={`...
function BestFood({ food, handleFoodChange }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <label>Food</label>
      <input value={food} onChange={handleFoodChange} />
    </div>
  );
}  
...
  
function Display({ name, food }) { 
  return (
    <div>Hey {name}, you are great, and your 
    favorite food is {food}.</div>
  );
 }

export default function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const [food, setFood] = useState("");
  
  const handleNameChange = (event) => setName(event.target.value);
  const handleFoodChange = (event) => setFood(event.target.value);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Name name={name} handleNameChange={handleNameChange} />
      <BestFood food={food} handleFoodChange={handleFoodChange} />
      <Display name={name} food={food} />
    </div>
  );
}`}
/>
{
  <Text>
    Once you learn how to do this, it becomes second nature. But one thing we’re
    not quite as good as is pushing state back down, or {''}
    <QuoteText quote="colocating" /> state.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Let’s say our <QuoteText quote="Display" /> use case gets changed and we no
    longer need to pass the food down.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Often, people will actually just leave it right there without making any
    other changes. But we need to remember that we no longer need this {''}
    <QuoteText quote="food" /> prop on the <QuoteText quote="Display" /> where we’re
    rendering it.{' '}
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    And because the <QuoteText quote="food" /> state is only being used by a
    single component, we can move it back to that component to get it colocated.
  </Text>
}
<CodeBlock
  value={`...
function BestFood() {
  const [food, setFood] = useState("");
  const handleFoodChange = (event) => setFood(event.target.value);
  return (
    <div>
      <label>Food</label>
      <input value={food} onChange={handleFoodChange} />
    </div>
  );
}  
...
export default function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");
  const handleNameChange = (event) => setName(event.target.value);
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Name name={name} handleNameChange={handleNameChange} />
      <BestFood />
      <Display name={name} />
    </div>
  );
}`}
/>
{
  <Text>
    And with that we’ve colocated our state, making the app more performant and
    easier to maintain on the long run.{' '}
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Truth is there are only a few states that are considered truly global,
    {''} e.g. <QuoteText quote="theme" /> (light or dark mode), every other local
    state should either be stored in the function where it is called or colocated
    in the nearest common parent.
  </Text>
}
<AnchorTag text="Prop Drilling" href="prop-drilling" />
{
  <Text>
    When building large applications, passing state can get a little complicated
    when you have many layers of components and you need to pass some piece of
    state deeply through the tree. The nearest common parent could be far
    removed from the components that need data, and lifting state up that high
    can lead to a situation sometimes called {''}
    <QuoteText quote="prop drilling." />
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    A simple way to look at prop drilling is that a parent creates a state,
    passes it down to “middle men”; components that do not require the state,
    and then down the tree eventually to the component(s) that needs it.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    In other words, a component receives a state or props just so that another
    component below it can access that.{' '}
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Most react devs avoid it and would reach for libraries such as {''}
    <QuoteText quote="redux" /> or <ExternalUrl
      text="React context"
      href="https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useContext"
    /> the moment they encounter this problem.
  </Text>
}
<InfoNote note="Don't be afraid of prop drilling" />
<Text>Let’s look at an example of prop drilling in action.</Text>
<CodeBlock
  value={`import {useState} from 'react';
  
export default function App() {
  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState({name: ''});
  
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <main>
        {currentUser.name !== '' ? (
          <>
            <Dashboard user={currentUser} />
            <LogoutButton onLogout={() => setCurrentUser({name: ''})} />
          </>
        ) : (
          <LoginScreen onLogin={() => setCurrentUser({name: 'Dayo'})} />
        )}
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
  
function Dashboard({ user }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>The Dashboard</h1>
      <DashboardNav />
      <DashboardContent user={user} />
    </>
  );
}
  
function DashboardNav() {
  return <h2>Dashboard Nav</h2>;
}
  
function DashboardContent({ user }) {
  return (

      <h2>Dashboard Content</h2>
      <WelcomeMessage user={user} />
    </>
  );
}
  
function WelcomeMessage({ user }) {
  return <h3>Welcome, {user.name}!</h3>;
}
  
function Header() {
  return <h1>Header</h1>;
}
  
function Footer() {
  return <h1>Footer</h1>;
}
  
function LoginScreen({ onLogin }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h4>Please login</h4>
      <button onClick={onLogin}>Login</button>
    </>
  );
}
  
function LogoutButton({ onLogout }) {
  return (
    <button
      className="my-2 text-white text-[0.875rem] bg-info rounded p-1 font-medium"
      onClick={onLogout}
    >
      Logout
    </button>
  );
}
`}
/>
<ComponentCompositionWithChildrenTemplate />
{
  <Text>
    Here, we have this Dashboard layout where the {''}
    <QuoteText quote="WelcomeMessage" /> is being displayed based on the current
    user's name. To get the value, we would need to prop drill the {''}
    <QuoteText quote="user" /> object three levels deep until it gets to the{' '}
    <QuoteText quote="WelcomeMessage" /> component.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    This is a contrived example, and prop drilling may not be a big deal in such
    a scenario and in many instances for that matter, but it can be an annoyance
    in really complex state management architectures.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    When you truly encounter the latter and prop drilling may potentially
    complicate your state management, then there's a couple of other solutions
    we can use to avoid prop drilling. The first is {''}
    <QuoteText quote="component composition" />.
  </Text>
}
<AnchorTag text="Component Composition" href="component-composition" />
{
  <Text>
    With composition, you basically make a prop that is the react element that
    you want to render in a specific place.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Let's use the same prop drilling example and see how we can use composition
    instead.
  </Text>
}
<CodeBlock
  value={`export default function App() {
  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState({name: ''});
  
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <main>
        {currentUser.name !== '' ? (
          <>
            <Dashboard>
              <DashboardNav />
              <DashboardContent user={currentUser} />
            </Dashboard>
            <LogoutButton onLogout={() => setCurrentUser({name: ''})} />
          </>
        ) : (
          <LoginScreen onLogin={() => setCurrentUser({name: 'Dayo'})} />
        )}
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
...
function Dashboard({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>The Dashboard</h1>
      {children}
    </>
  );
}
...`}
/>
{
  <Text>
    We have eliminated one level of prop drilling. We no longer pass the {''}
    <QuoteText quote="DashboardNav" />
    and {''}
    <QuoteText quote="DashboardContent" /> inside the Dashboard, instead we pass
    it the special {''}
    <QuoteText quote="children" />
    prop and pass the <QuoteText quote="user" /> directly to the <QuoteText quote="DashboardContent" />

    .

  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    Let's take it a step further and do the same thing for the Dashboard
    content.
  </Text>
}
<CodeBlock
  value={`export default function App() {
  const [currentUser, setCurrentUser] = useState({name: ''});
  
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <main>
        {currentUser.name !== '' ? (
          <>
            <Dashboard>
              <DashboardNav />
              <DashboardContent>
                <WelcomeMessage user={currentUser} />
              </DashboardContent>
            </Dashboard>
            <LogoutButton onLogout={() => setCurrentUser({name: ''})} />
          </>
        ) : (
          <LoginScreen onLogin={() => setCurrentUser({name: 'Dayo'})} />
        )}
      </main>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
...  
function DashboardContent({ children }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Dashboard Content</h2>
      {children}
    </>
  );
}
...`}
/>
{
  <Text>
    And like that the Dashboard is more composable and customizable. And we're
    no longer prop drilling.
  </Text>
}
{<Text>Our app works like before too.</Text>}
<ComponentCompositionWithChildren />
{
  <Text>
    Sometimes you may need multiple “holes” in a component. Another way React
    composes is to make a component that is a wrapper for another component. In
    such cases you may come up with your own convention instead of using the{' '}
    {''}
    <QuoteText quote="children" /> prop.
  </Text>
}
<Text>Let's see it in action.</Text>
<CodeBlock
  value={`export default function App() {
  return <ChatApp left={<Contacts />} right={<Chat />} />;
}
  
function Contacts() {
  return <div>Contacts</div>;
}
  
function Chat() {
  return <div>Chat</div>;
}
  
function ChatApp({ left, right }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>{left}</div>
      <div>{right}</div>
    </div>
  );
}`}
/>
{
  <Text>
    What we have simply done is pass arbitrary values as props to the {''}
    <QuoteText quote="ChatApp" /> component.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    React elements like <QuoteText quote="Contacts" /> and {''}
    <QuoteText quote="Chat" /> are just objects, so they can be passed as props like
    any other data. This is a very common use case for composition.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    The next solution is the {''}

<AnchorTag text="React Context" href="react-context" />
{
  <Text>
    {' '}
    Context is useful when you have some value that you want to make accessible to
    a portion of your React component tree, without passing that value down as props
    through each level of components.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    We'll use {''}
    <ExternalUrl
      text="react context"
      href="https://beta.reactjs.org/apis/react/useContext"
    /> to simplify the state management of our previous Dashboard app.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    What we simply need to do is create a context using the {''}
    <QuoteText quote="createContext" /> API, and wrap our <QuoteText quote="App" />{' '}
    component with the context provider.
  </Text>
}
{
  <Text>
    We also removed the user object from the {''}
    <QuoteText quote="Dashboard" />, {''}
    <QuoteText quote="DashboardContent" />, and {''}
    <QuoteText quote="WelcomeMessage" />
    components.

    the <QuoteText quote="currentUser" /> object using the useContext API and
    use the <QuoteText quote="user" /> directly inside the{' '}
    <QuoteText quote="WelcomeMessage" /> component.
  </Text>
}
