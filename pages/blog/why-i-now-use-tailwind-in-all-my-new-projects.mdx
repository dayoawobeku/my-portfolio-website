{<Text>In simple terms, {''}

{<Text>Tailwind is an excellent solution for developers familiar with CSS who
want to speed up the creation and design process in the long run.</Text>}

{<Text>While Tailwind helps you get better with CSS, I would still argue that
you need to learn CSS at least to a basic extent before picking up a tool like
Tailwind. And by "basic", I mean you should be familiar with stuff like the {''}

<DangerNote note="I do not think it’s such a great idea to use Tailwind if you are not familiar with plain old vanilla CSS." />

{<Text>Like many people, the first time I used {''}

<ExternalUrl href='https://tailwindcss.com/' text='Tailwind' />, I didn’t
exactly understand all that was happening. It felt too easy and difficult at the
same time. I left it for a while, and came back to it and I totally loved
it.</Text>}

{<Text>I'm not saying {''}

<ExternalUrl href='https://tailwindcss.com/' text='Tailwind' /> is the best
thing to happen to humanity after sliced bread? But, {''}
<ExternalUrl href='https://tailwindcss.com/' text='Tailwind' /> does make your
life significantly simpler.</Text>}

{<ListNumber>1. It is simple to set up and highly customizable.</ListNumber>}

{<Text>Before I got into {''}

<ExternalUrl href='https://tailwindcss.com/' text='Tailwind' />, I’d used {''}
<ExternalUrl href='https://getbootstrap.com/' text='Bootstrap' /> for a while and {''}
<ExternalUrl href='https://getbootstrap.com/' text='Bootstrap' /> is great, no
doubt. But the major issue I had was customization. At the company I work with at the moment, <ExternalUrl href='https://dojah.io/' text='Dojah' />,
we use a lot of custom designs, spacing, and components.</Text>}

{<Text>And many times, we would revert to using the <QuoteText quote='style' />
prop to add an extra layer of styling because
{''}<ExternalUrl href='https://getbootstrap.com/' text='Bootstrap' /> wasn’t
just enough! Did I even mention the numerous extra classes we added in the {''}

<QuoteText quote="global.css" /> file because {''}

<ExternalUrl href='https://getbootstrap.com/' text='Bootstrap' /> didn’t give us
the measurements we needed out of the box?</Text>}

<InfoNote
  note="I'm not comparing both tools because they are intrinsically different.
Bootstrap is great if you need an already built set of tools and components to
plug in to. Tailwind on the other hand provides you with the utilities and you
build every other thing yourself."

{<Text>And that's where Tailwind shines. You can easily add your own extra layer
of configuration in the {''} <QuoteText quote="tailwind.config" /> file and the
balance of the earth remains the same. And if peradventure you need an

  href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values"
  text="arbitrary value"

<QuoteText quote="top-[117px]" />. Easy.</Text>}

{<ListNumber extraMarginTop>2. Tailwind's Responsive Design is just
awesome.</ListNumber>}

{<Text>Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different
breakpoints, which makes it super simple to build complex responsive interfaces
without ever leaving your HTML.</Text>}
