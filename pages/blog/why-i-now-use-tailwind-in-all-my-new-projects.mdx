<InfoNote note="Tailwind CSS is awesome!" />

{<Text>In simple terms, {''}

<ExternalUrl href='https://tailwindcss.com/' text='Tailwindcss' /> is a
utility-first CSS framework.</Text>}

{<Text>Utility-first CSS is the notion of composing many small classes together
such as <BoldText text='flex' />, <BoldText text='pt-4' />, {''}

<BoldText text='text-center' />.</Text>}

{<Text>Tailwind is an excellent solution for developers familiar with CSS who
want to speed up the creation and design process in the long run.</Text>}

{<Text>While Tailwind helps you get better with CSS, I would still argue that
you need to learn CSS at least to a basic extent before picking up a tool like
Tailwind. And by "basic", I mean you should be familiar with stuff like the {''}

  text="transitions"

<DangerNote note="I do not think it’s such a great idea to use Tailwind if you are not familiar with plain old vanilla CSS." />

{<Text>Like many people, the first time I used {''}

<ExternalUrl href='https://tailwindcss.com/' text='Tailwind' />, I didn’t
exactly understand all that was happening. It felt too easy and difficult at the
same time. I left it for a while and came back to it and I loved
it.</Text>}

{<Text>I'm not saying {''}

<ExternalUrl href='https://tailwindcss.com/' text='Tailwind' /> is the best
thing to happen to humanity after sliced bread. But {''}
<ExternalUrl href='https://tailwindcss.com/' text='Tailwind' /> does make your
life significantly simpler.</Text>}

<AnchorTag
  text="Here are a few reasons why I love and use Tailwind"
  href="why-I-love-and-use-Tailwind"
/>

{<ListNumber>1. It is simple to set up and highly customizable</ListNumber>}

{<Text>Before I got into {''}

<ExternalUrl href='https://tailwindcss.com/' text='Tailwind' />, I’d used {''}
<ExternalUrl href='https://getbootstrap.com/' text='Bootstrap' /> for a while and {''}
<ExternalUrl href='https://getbootstrap.com/' text='Bootstrap' /> is great, no
doubt. But the major issue I had was with customization. At the company I work with at the moment, <ExternalUrl href='https://dojah.io/' text='Dojah' />,
we use a lot of custom designs, spacing, and components.</Text>}

{<Text>And many times, we would revert to using the <QuoteText quote='style' />
prop in React to add an extra layer of styling because {''}

<ExternalUrl href="https://getbootstrap.com/" text="Bootstrap" /> wasn’t just enough!
Did I even mention the numerous extra classes we added in the {''}

<QuoteText quote="global.css" /> file because {''}

<ExternalUrl href='https://getbootstrap.com/' text='Bootstrap' /> didn’t give us
the measurements we needed out of the box?</Text>}

<InfoNote
  note="I'm not comparing both tools because they are intrinsically different.
Bootstrap is great if you need an already-built set of tools and components to
plug into. Tailwind on the other hand provides you with the utilities and you
build every other thing yourself."
/>

{<Text>And that's where Tailwind shines. You can easily add your extra layer of
configuration by {''}

<ExternalUrl
  href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing#extending-the-default-spacing-scale"
  text="extending"
/> the {''} <QuoteText quote="tailwind.config" /> file and the balance of the earth
remains the same. </Text>}

{<Text>If you want to add your custom components, you can do that too by using
the {' '}

<ExternalUrl
  href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/reusing-styles#extracting-classes-with-apply"
  text="@apply"
/> directive.</Text>}

{<Text> And if peradventure you need an {''}<ExternalUrl
  href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values"
  text="arbitrary value"
/>, you can easily add it to your className prop like so: {''}

<QuoteText quote="top-[117px]" />. Easy.</Text>}

{<ListNumber extraMarginTop>2. Tailwind's Responsive Design is just
awesome</ListNumber>}

{<Text>Every utility class in Tailwind can be applied conditionally at different
breakpoints, which makes it super simple to build complex responsive interfaces
without ever leaving your HTML.</Text>}

{<Text>For example, if you want to change the background color of a div at a
{''} <ExternalUrl
  href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#responsive-design"
  text="specific breakpoint" />, you can do that by adding the {''}

<QuoteText quote="md" /> {''} prefix to the {''} <QuoteText quote="bg" /> {''}
class like so: {''} <QuoteText quote="bg-red-500 md:bg-blue-500 text-white xl:text-grey" />.</Text>}

{<Text> Tailwind uses a mobile-first approach to responsive design, which means
that by default, all of your utility classes apply at all screen sizes unless
you specify otherwise. This is a great default because it means you spend less
time writing CSS.</Text>}

{<Text>This is a lot easier than using media queries in CSS. And if you are
familiar with CSS, you can easily use Tailwind's responsive design to your
advantage.</Text>}

{<ListNumber extraMarginTop>3. Tailwind is incredibly performance
focused</ListNumber>}

{<Text>By default, CSS is treated as a render-blocking resource, which means
that the browser won't render any processed content until the {''}

<ExternalUrl
  href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model"
  text="CSSOM" />
{''} is ready. This is a problem because the browser has to wait for the CSS to be parsed and applied before it can start rendering the page.</Text>}

{<Text>And this is where Tailwind shines, yet again. Tailwind aims to produce
the smallest CSS file possible by only generating the CSS you are actually using
in your project. See how they do it {''}

<ExternalUrl
  href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/optimizing-for-production#removing-unused-css"
  text="here" />.
</Text>}

{<ListNumber extraMarginTop> 4. Pairs well with component-based UI
frameworks/libraries</ListNumber>}

{<Text>Asides from the fact that you can use Tailwind in a regular HTML file,
you can also use it with any UI framework/library of your choice.</Text>}

{<Text>I have used Tailwind with {''}

<ExternalUrl href="https://reactjs.org/" text="React" />, {''}
<ExternalUrl href="https://nextjs.org/" text="Next js" />, and {''}
<ExternalUrl href="https://kit.svelte.dev/" text="SvelteKit" />, and it works
like a charm. Their{' '}

<ExternalUrl href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation" text="documentation" />
is also very detailed and easy to follow.</Text>}

{<ListNumber extraMarginTop> 5. Tailwind has a great community</ListNumber>}

{<Text>One of the things I love about Tailwind is the very active and helpful
community. There's a plethora of resources on the internet to help you get
started with Tailwind, and if you are stuck, you can always ask for help on the
Tailwind{' '}

<AnchorTag text="Conclusion" href="conclusion" />

{<Text>Tailwind is great, again. But not every project requires Tailwind CSS.
Sometimes, you’re just better off with plain old vanilla CSS, or a UI framework
like {''}<ExternalUrl
  href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/
" text="Bootstrap"
/> or {''} <ExternalUrl href="https://chakra-ui.com/" text="Chakra UI" />.
Tailwind also has its UI framework called {''}
