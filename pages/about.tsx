              My journey into the tech world began with a simple yet magical

              TL:DR; Today, I'm a bit of a unicorn. I'm a frontend developer but

          I started out as a self-taught developer. I learned the basics of HTML
          and CSS from freeCodeCamp and Codecademy and then moved on to
          JavaScript three different times before I finally got it. I just
          couldn't wrap my head around it. I was so frustrated that I almost
          gave up. But I didn't. I kept pushing. And I pushed myself to
          believing that{' '}

            "Product Design is probably easier than this JavaScript thing

        <p className="mt-10 text-3md text-body dark:text-grey-600">
          I persevered and learnt the basics of UI/UX design in a few months. I
          was able to design a few projects and got a few freelance gigs. But I
          still wasn't satisfied. I wanted to{' '}
          <span className="font-bold">build</span> more. So I went back to
          JavaScript. And this time, I was able to learn it. I was able to build
          more complex projects. I was able to build products that people would
          use. And I was able to get a job as a frontend developer.

          My passion for this craft has driven me to co-found two open-source
          projects: album colors (a visual directory that draws colour palette
          inspiration from music album covers); and Sitesnap.design (a curated
          collection of websites designed by Africans), write technical
          articles, and mentor aspiring developers. These initiatives show my
          commitment to the developer community and my ability to build
          practical tools that make the world a better place through quality
          software.

          I have experience working with a variety of technologies, including

          including Figma, Adobe XD, and user research techniques. My ability to
